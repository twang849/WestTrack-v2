## Example Usage

```python
from agentic.common import Agent
from agentic.tools import MeetingBaasTool

# Create an agent with meeting capabilities
meeting_agent = Agent(
    name="Meeting Assistant",
    instructions="You help users join, record, and summarize video meetings.",
    tools=[MeetingBaasTool()]
)

# Use the agent to join a meeting
response = meeting_agent << "Join the Zoom meeting at https://zoom.us/j/123456789"
print(response)

# Use the agent to get a meeting transcript
response = meeting_agent << "Get the transcript from my last meeting"
print(response)

# Use the agent to summarize a meeting
response = meeting_agent << "Summarize what was discussed in the marketing meeting yesterday"
print(response)
```

## Database Storage

The tool automatically stores meeting information in a SQLite database:

- Meeting metadata (ID, URL, start/end time, status)
- Transcripts
- Generated summaries
- Attendees
- Recording URLs

## RAG Implementation

The tool uses Retrieval Augmented Generation for answering questions about meetings:

1. Meeting summaries are indexed in a vector database (Weaviate)
2. Embeddings are created using the BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5 model
3. When a question is asked, relevant chunks of meeting content are retrieved
4. The context is returned for the agent to formulate an answer

## Webhook Support

The tool can receive and process webhooks from the MeetingBaaS service:

- Meeting status changes
- Completion notifications
- Error reports

## Notes

- Requires a public URL for webhook callbacks (uses devtunnel for local development)
- Transcription is performed by the MeetingBaaS service
- Summaries are generated using OpenAI's GPT-4o model
- Meeting bots can join Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, and other platforms
- Vector storage enables semantic search across meeting content
