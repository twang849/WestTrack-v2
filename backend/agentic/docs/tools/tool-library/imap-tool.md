# IMAPTool

The `IMAPTool` provides email inbox access capabilities via the IMAP protocol. This tool allows agents to retrieve, list, and send emails, providing a comprehensive interface for email management.

## Features

- Connect to email accounts using IMAP
- List and retrieve emails with filtering options
- Send and draft emails
- Extract email content and attachments
- Process emails with tracking to avoid duplicates

## Authentication

Requires email credentials which can be:

- Stored in Agentic's secrets system as `IMAP_USERNAME` and `IMAP_PASSWORD`
- For Gmail, it's recommended to use an App Password rather than your account password

from agentic.tools import IMAPTool

# Create an agent with email capabilities
email_agent = Agent(
    name="Email Assistant",
    instructions="You help manage emails, retrieving and sending messages.",
    tools=[IMAPTool()]
)

# The agent will prompt for IMAP credentials if they aren't already set
# agentic secrets set IMAP_USERNAME="your.email@gmail.com"
# agentic secrets set IMAP_PASSWORD="your-app-password"

# Use the agent to check recent emails
response = email_agent << "Show me my latest emails"
print(response)

# Use the agent to search for specific emails
response = email_agent << "Find emails with 'invoice' in the subject from the last 7 days"
print(response)

# Use the agent to draft an email
response = email_agent << "Draft a response to the latest email from my boss"
print(response)
```

## Search Criteria Syntax

The tool supports IMAP search syntax for advanced filtering:

- `FROM "sender@example.com"`: Emails from a specific sender
- `SUBJECT "important"`: Emails with a specific subject word
- `TO "recipient@example.com"`: Emails to a specific recipient
- `SINCE "1-Jan-2023"`: Emails since a specific date
- `UNSEEN`: Unread emails
- `FLAGGED`: Starred/flagged emails

Criteria can be combined: `(FROM "amazon.com") AND (SUBJECT "order")`

## Notes

- The tool primarily supports Gmail but works with most IMAP-compatible email providers
- For Gmail, you need to enable "Less secure app access" or use an App Password
- Email attachments are saved to a temporary directory
- The tool tracks processed emails to avoid duplicates when using `retrieve_emails_once`
- HTML emails are automatically converted to plain text
