BACHELOR OF MEDICAL SCIENCES (BMSc) PROGRAM
Admission to the Bachelor of Medical Sciences (BMSc) Program
BACHELOR OF MEDICAL SCIENCES (BMSc) PROGRAM

The Bachelor of Medical Sciences (BMSc) Program, offered jointly by the Faculty of Science and the Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, offers four-year undergraduate degrees for students interested in studying the basic medical sciences. The Honours Specialization, Specialization, and Double Major modules that lead to graduation with BMSc degrees are collectively referred to as the BMSc Program.

Admission to the BMSc Program does not guarantee admission to a particular Honours Specialization module as each of these modules has a limited capacity.

Admission to the BMSc Program occurs in Year 3, usually after the successful completion of Medical Sciences 1 and 2 (see the policy on Medical Sciences First Entry). When applying for admission to the BMSc Program in Year 3, students also apply for admission to the various modules offered in the BMSc Program. Students must be admitted to the BMSc Program in Year 3 to be eligible to progress to the BMSc Program in Year 4.

Although admission to the BMSc Program in Year 3 is assured for students in Medical Sciences 2 who satisfy certain conditions, it is anticipated that space will be available for additional students. These students will comprise the “competitive pool”.

Assured Admission to Year 3 BMSc for Students in Medical Sciences 2:
For assured admission, the following conditions must be satisfied by the end of the Fall/Winter of Medical Sciences 2:

• A full load of 5.0 courses must be successfully completed (i.e., no failures) during the Fall/Winter of Medical Sciences 2 (September-April);
• Any course(s) taken during the summer sessions either before or after Medical Sciences 2 must be successfully completed (i.e., no failures);
• All courses listed in the Admission Requirements for the module to which the student applies must be completed by the end of the Fall/Winter of Medical Sciences 2. See the BMSc website for more information about admission to BMSc Double Majors;
• The specified minimum mark must be achieved in the first attempt at each course listed in the Admission Requirements for the module to which the student applies;
• A minimum average of 80% must be achieved on the 2000-level courses listed in the Admission Requirements for the module to which the student applies. If 3.5 or more 2000-level courses are listed in the Admission Requirements, a minimum average of 80% is required on the best 3.0 of these 2000-level courses.

Students in Medical Sciences 2 who satisfy the conditions for assured admission receive priority placement in Honours Specialization modules in Year 3 BMSc. The capacity of each Honours Specialization module is limited in Years 3 and 4 due to the maximum capacity in laboratory and capstone courses. See Modules Offered in the BMSc Program (below) for details about admission to Honours Specialization modules, as well as to Specialization modules and Double Majors, in Years 3 and 4, and the BMSc website for additional information. 

Admission to Year 3 BMSc for Students in the Competitive Pool:
For admission from the competitive pool, the following conditions must be satisfied prior to the beginning (September) of Year 3:

Although a full load of 5.0 courses is not required in Year 2, students must be eligible to register in Year 3 (e.g., must successfully complete at least 8.0 courses);

All courses taken during the Fall/Winter of Year 2 and during the summer after Year 2 must be successfully completed (i.e., no failures);
A minimum mark of 60% must be achieved in each 1000-level half course listed in the Admission Requirements for the module to which the student applies (repeats of these 1000-level courses are permitted);
All courses listed in the Admission Requirements for the module(s) to which the student applies must be completed prior to the beginning (September) of Year 3. See the BMSc website for more information about admission to BMSc Double Majors;
A minimum average of 75% must be achieved on the 2000-level courses listed in the Admission Requirements for the module to which the student applies. If, however, the Admission Requirements list 3.5 or more 2000-level courses, a minimum average of 75% is required on the best 3.0 of these 2000-level courses. Note that an average greater than 75% may be required for admission, depending on the number of applicants from the competitive pool and the number of spaces remaining in Year 3 of the BMSc Program.
The specified minimum mark must be achieved in each of the 2000-level courses listed in the Admission Requirements for the module(s) to which the student applies. Students may repeat a maximum of one of these 2000-level half courses and, if one of these 2000-level half courses is repeated, the average on both attempts in the course must be at least 60% and will be used in calculating the minimum average;
Students admitted to Year 3 BMSc from the competitive pool are registered in their modules after students in Medical Sciences 2 who satisfied the conditions for assured admission. The capacity of each Honours Specialization module is limited in Years 3 and 4 due to the maximum capacity in laboratory and capstone courses. See Modules Offered in the BMSc Program (below) for details about admission to Honours Specialization modules, as well as Specialization modules and Double Majors, in Years 3 and 4, and the BMSc website for more information.

Modules Offered in the BMSc Program
The Honours Specialization, Specialization, and Double Major modules that lead to graduation with BMSc degrees are collectively referred to as the BMSc Program.

Honours Specialization Modules:

Admission to the BMSc Program does not guarantee admission to a particular Honours Specialization module as each of these modules has a limited capacity.

Year 3:
Once admitted to Year 3 of the BMSc Program, admission to each Honours Specialization module requires completion of ALL of the courses listed in the Admission Requirements for the Honours Specialization module to which the student applies and is based on the average obtained on ALL the 2000-level courses listed in the Admission Requirements. If the Admission Requirements list 3.5 or more 2000-level courses, admission is based on the average obtained on the best 3.0 of these 2000-level courses. A minimum mark of 60% must be achieved in any additional modular course(s) completed.

Students satisfying the conditions for assured admission to Year 3 of the BMSc Program from MEDICAL SCIENCES FIRST ENTRY (Medical Sciences 2) will receive priority placement in the Honours Specialization modules in Year 3. Once these students have been adjudicated into the Honours Specialization modules, students admitted to Year 3 of the BMSc Program from the competitive pool will be adjudicated into the remaining spaces in the Honours Specialization modules.

Year 4:

The following provisions for admission to an Honours Specialization in Year 4 apply only to students registered in Years 3 and 4 of an Honours Specialization module in 2024-25 or earlier.

Note: For students registered in Year 3 of an Honours Specialization module in 2025-26 and onward:

Progression to Year 4 of each Honours Specialization in the BMSc program will be dependent on completion of the progression requirements as identified on the module page in the Academic Calendar.

Permission may be granted to BMSc students for admission to a particular Honours Specialization module in Year 4 if space is available and the minimum Admission and Progression Requirements are met.

Admission to an Honours Specialization module in Year 4 requires a minimum Weighted Average of 75% and completion of ALL of the courses indicated in the Weighted Average Chart below. Admission is not guaranteed as each of these modules has a limited capacity. Any student in Year 3 BMSc with the appropriate courses can apply for admission to Year 4 of any Honours Specialization module.

BREADTH REQUIREMENTS FOR BACHELOR DEGREES
First-Year Program
Students are required to meet the breadth requirements for bachelor degrees in order to widen their knowledge and understanding across a broader range of disciplines. Exposure to different disciplines enables students to develop insight and experience in areas distinct from their main fields of study.

First-Year Program
Students registering in general first-year programs must choose courses that fulfill the basic requirement of 5.0 courses numbered 1000-1999. The 5.0 courses must include at least four different subjects with no more than 2.0 courses in one subject. Additionally, students are subject to the Breadth Requirements outlined below. Students are encouraged to take an essay course in first year.

Except with Special Permission, a student must not register for a full program of senior courses (numbered 2000 - 4999) until the 5.0 courses of first year have been completed satisfactorily.

Students are responsible for choosing courses that fulfill the prerequisites for senior courses (numbered 2000 - 4999). Specific prerequisites are included in the individual course descriptions listed in the UNDERGRADUATE COURSE INFORMATION. If in doubt, students should seek appropriate counselling and consult directly with the department(s) concerned. Prospective first-year students should seek help in choosing courses during the Summer Academic Orientation.

Part-time students who have completed 1.0 first-year course are eligible to register in senior courses (numbered 2000 - 4999) for which they have completed the prerequisite(s). Part-time students who have a substantial background and interest in a particular subject area are eligible, on written recommendation of the Dean of their Faculty, to register in a senior course pertinent to that subject prior to the completion of a first-year course. All part-time students must successfully complete the 5.0 first-year courses within their first 10.0 courses attempted.

CONVOCATION; GRADUATION DIPLOMAS AND CERTIFICATES
Convocation Ceremonies
Scheduling Convocation Ceremonies

The in absentia February Convocation will normally be scheduled for the last Friday in February.
June Convocation ceremonies will normally be scheduled from Monday to Friday in the second or third full week in June.
The Huron University College (Theology) Convocation ceremonies will be scheduled in consultation with the Affiliated University College. 
October Convocation ceremonies will normally be scheduled in the first full week following Thanksgiving.
Recipients of Certificates and Diplomas will be listed in the Convocation Program, and will be permitted to participate in the graduation ceremonies.

Recipients of Two Degrees, Diplomas or Certificates
When a candidate is to be awarded two degrees, diplomas or certificates (or any combination of these) during one convocation period, the Registrar will be permitted to release both diplomas to the graduand at the convocation ceremony of the first degree program scheduled in the convocation period.

Awarding Double Degrees at Convocation
For students who are eligible to receive two degrees at convocation:

If both degrees are to be awarded at the same convocation ceremony, the student may cross the stage only once, and must make a choice as to the degree grouping with which they will process.
If the two degrees are to be awarded at different convocation ceremonies, the student may cross the stage in one or both ceremonies. Both diplomas will normally be given to the graduate at the first of the ceremonies in which they participate.

Degrees, Diplomas and Certificates [to be conferred officially at convocation ceremonies]
Degrees, diplomas and certificates will be officially conferred or awarded at the appropriate convocation ceremony following successful completion of the program requirements and an application to graduate if required, or will be available for pickup by the graduate within three business days subsequent to the ceremony. Degrees, diplomas and certificates are retained in the Office of the Registrar for two years after Convocation.

Candidates who meet the requirements for graduation in diploma and certificate programs will be issued a Notification of Eligibility to Graduate (rather than an application to graduate, required of potential degree recipients).

Degrees, diplomas and certificates normally will not be awarded in advance of convocation ceremonies. A degree, diploma, or certificate may be released early at the discretion of the Office of the Registrar if the student demonstrates that the document is required by an employer or for a work visa and if it is determined that the student is eligible and has applied to graduate. Students presenting an official offer of employment or deadline relating to an application for a visa may, by application and payment of the appropriate fee to the Office of the Registrar, request release of their document no sooner than four weeks prior to their scheduled convocation. The document released will bear the date of the appropriate scheduled convocation ceremony.

All other students who require notice of confirmation that their program has been completed (in addition to an official transcript) may apply to the Office of the Registrar with a request for a letter attesting to the fact that they have completed the requirements of their program.

If a student’s degree, diploma or certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed OR the student requires a duplicate or duplicates, subsequent diplomas can be produced by application and payment of the appropriate fee to the Office of the Registrar. All subsequent degrees, diplomas and certificates will be issued:

    • using the current Western diploma printing standards and Officers
    • with the words “Duplicate Copy” affixed to the parchment


Degree Diplomas for DDS Graduates: (Exception for DDS graduates who satisfy requirements between June and October)
In order to practice dentistry, graduates of the DDS program must present a copy of their diploma to the Royal College of Dental Surgeons and thus obtain a certificate of registration. In April 1994, Senate approved that the degree of Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS) be granted retroactively to June for students who satisfy all of the requirements for graduation after the June convocation date for Dentistry but before the October convocation. Based on this precedent, Senate approved procedures for granting a DDS degree to a student in the program who completes the degree requirements after Autumn Convocation in October. The date that will appear on the degree is the date on which all degree requirements were completed. The graduate's name and the date of the degree will appear in the Program of the Spring Convocation that next follows, and the graduate may request the opportunity to participate in the Spring Convocation next following.

In Absentia Convocation in February
Senate approved the establishment of an in absentia Convocation to be held in mid-February for students who complete their degree requirements by the end of the preceding fall term. Students who have their degrees conferred in February will be given the opportunity to participate in the appropriate June convocation ceremony.

Statement re Posthumous Degrees
Contingent on approval by the Dean or Vice-Provost (Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies), in consultation with the Provost, a posthumous degree may be granted at a Convocation ceremony.

DENTISTRY - PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS AND PROGRESSION
Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS) Program and DDS Advanced Standing Program for International Dental Graduates (IDG), Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS AND PROGRESSION

The Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS) program in the Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry is a four-year program, however for international dental graduates it is a three-year program with students starting in Year 2. The program is divided into integrated years of learning offering large and small group, laboratory, pre-clinical Simulation Clinic, Dental Clinic, and Community Service.

Years 1 and Year 2 courses involve both in-person and online learning; laboratory experiences; pre-clinical dental simulation; large group learning; and small group learning. Students are required to successfully complete all course requirements in Year 1 before transitioning to Year 2, as well as successfully complete all Year 2 requirements before transitioning to Year 3.

Year 3 courses involve both in-person and online learning. Year 3 is a clinically intensive year in the Dental Clinic, providing students with a broad-clinical experience emphasizing a comprehensive patient-centered approach to oral health. Students are required to successfully complete all requirements prior to transitioning to Year 4.

Year 4 courses involve both in-person and online learning and the majority of courses occur in the Fall. Year 4 is a clinically intensive year in the Dental Clinic providing students with a broad clinical experience emphasizing a comprehensive patient-centered approach to oral health. Students are required to successfully achieve competence in all requirements to be recommended for graduation.

The Academic Year

The academic year at the Schulich School of Dentistry comprises a period of approximately 32 weeks and is divided into two-terms. (See Schulich Dentistry – Sessional Dates).

The timetable for the first term is available one-week prior to the first day of classes. Schulich Dentistry may, on notice, schedule compulsory classes and seminars additional to those indicated on the timetable.

During the examination period, only mid-term and/or final written and/or practical examinations will be held.

The fall term, including the examination week, shall not extend beyond December 22 in any year.

The winter term shall normally begin on the Monday of the first full week in January.

No lectures, seminars, laboratory or preclinical or clinical sessions shall be scheduled for Years 1, 2, 3, and 4 during the examination week(s).

Term tests that are not mid-terms are to be scheduled at times normally assigned to a course for lectures, seminars and/or laboratories but not within two weeks of the examination week(s).

A study week shall be scheduled during the March Break to coincide with the Schulich Doctor of Medicine Program.

PROGRAM REGULATIONS

Attendance

It is expected that students attend all scheduled curricular learning experiences in the DDS program, including laboratory, pre-clinical and clinical. Failure to attend curricular learning experiences, including scheduled pre-clinical and clinical sessions, without prior advanced approval will be considered a breach of professionalism and may result in a failing grade, remediation or dismissal.

Professional Ethical Standards

All candidates registered in the program are expected to be in compliance with Western University’s Degree Level Expectations, and all other applicable policies or statements governed by Western University, including the Code of Student Conduct, MAPP 1.35 – Non-Discrimination/Harassment/Sexual Misconduct Policy, and MAPP 1.46 – Safe Campus Community. In addition, candidates must develop and demonstrate the attributes of a professional as outlined and regulated by the Royal College of Dental Surgeons of Ontario (RCDSO), the Schulich Dentistry Professionalism Policy, and Schulich Medicine and Dentistry Charter of Professionalism.

Immunizations

On admission and for annual clearance, students are required to provide immunization documentation as it relates to the requirements of the Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry listed on the Learner Experience Office website.

Police Checks

Students enrolled in the DDS program are engaged in patient care, including vulnerable sectors (i.e., children, adolescents, special needs, adults, seniors, etc.) during their learning. To fulfill legal obligations that support patient safety, students will be required to submit their police record checks and vulnerable sector checks upon admission to the Program prior to beginning Year 1 studies and prior to the beginning of Years 3 and 4. Year 2 students must provide a signed declaration before beginning Year 2. This must be completed independently by the learner and submitted to the Learner Experience Office. Students are not permitted to commence their studies in Year 1, Year 3 and Year 4 if they do not submit or update required documentation of a clean police and vulnerable sector check. Students must consult the Admissions Office (for Year 1) and the Learner Experience Office (Years 2,3, and 4) about processes to follow in the event of a failed check.

Time Limitation for Completion of Program

The DDS program is a full-time, four-year professional academic program (or three-year for International Dental Graduates). Students on request to the Vice-Dean and Director of Dentistry may be granted a leave of absence while enrolled in their program studies. The DDS program however must be completed within five consecutive years (or four years for international dental graduates) of the original date of enrollment.

A student who fails to complete the DDS program within the stipulated consecutive time period, for any reason, must withdraw from the DDS program. Only under extenuating circumstances may a student apply for readmission to the DDS program, and there is no guarantee that a student will successfully gain readmission to the program. All applications for readmission to the DDS program are reviewed by the Vice-Dean and Director of Dentistry.

ASSESSMENT
Assessment in the DDS program occurs via different testing methods and the principal function is to provide feedback to support student learning and achievement of competence. All assessment activities are aligned with the competencies of a beginning dental practitioner in Canada which were established by the National Dental Examining Board of Canada.

Satisfactory Progression without Condition

To complete a year's work and be permitted to register in the succeeding year of the dental program, a student must:

Satisfactorily complete the prescribed assignments for both credit and non-credit courses;
Obtain at least a Pass level of performance in each credit course. 
Notes:

The pass level of performance will transition to 65% effective September 1, 2024 and 70% effective September 1, 2025. “Transition Year”: September 1, 2024 to August 31, 2025.

A course shall be defined as a discrete division of a general subject and is characterized by specific instruction and by examination specific to the said course. Where a general subject is not divided into discrete divisions it shall, for the purpose of these regulations, be considered a course.

In each course, the ratio of term grades to final examination grades is determined by the Course Director of the department concerned.
Eligibility for Awards

Students are required to achieve a passing grade without benefit of supplemental examination(s) in all courses of the academic year, as well as have no breaches of professionalism, to be eligible for Professional Awards in that year.

Conditional Progression

A student may be given permission by the Vice-Dean and Director of Dentistry to progress or continue in the dental program with conditions as noted below:

First and Second Years
A first or second-year student who fails either the written and/or preclinical laboratory component(s) of a course may be granted permission to write a supplemental examination in either or both components of that course. If a student is granted permission to take a supplemental examination in either or both components, the student:

1. must achieve a minimum Pass level of performance on the supplemental examination(s), otherwise the student will receive a grade of “fail”;
2. will be given a grade of 70% (Transition Year – 65%) in the course, regardless of the passing grade achieved on the supplemental examination

Third and Fourth Years
A third or fourth-year student who fails the written component of a course may be granted a supplemental examination in that component. If a student is granted permission to take a supplemental examination in either or both components, the student:

1. must achieve a minimum pass level of performance on the supplemental examination(s), otherwise the student will receive a grade of “fail”;
2. will be given a grade of 70% (Transition Year – 65%) in the course regardless of the passing grade achieved on the supplemental examination.

If, by the end of the academic year, a student in third or fourth-year has not completed all clinical cases, requirements and other assignments prescribed in a clinical component of a course, but has an overall passing grade in those activities that have been done, the Clinical Division may recommend that a grade of 'Incomplete' be given. The recommendation will include:

1. The type and extent of the work to be completed;
2. The date on which it must be completed;
3. The name of the Division who will evaluate the student's work;
4. The date by which the final grade will be forwarded to the Registrar's Office.

If a student fails to satisfactorily complete the clinical cases in the prescribed time necessary to remove the course grade of “incomplete”, this will result in a failure of the course.

No supplemental examinations will be permitted in the clinical component of third or fourth-year courses, 5320 and 5420. If, by the end of the academic year, a student in third or fourth-year has a failing grade in a clinical discipline within 5320 or 5420, that student shall be given a grade of "Fail" in 5320 or 5420.

Unsatisfactory Standing

A student shall be considered to have failed the year if the student attains:

1. Less than a Pass level of performance in one or more courses or components of courses where supplemental examination(s) are not granted;
2. Less than a Pass level of performance in a supplemental examination.
3. Fails 30% of their course load in a single year. Course load will be determined by the number of course credits. Each course is equivalent to one course credit whether it is a half-year or full-year course.

Requirement to Repeat a Failed Year

Students who have been considered to have failed the year will be required to either repeat the year or withdraw from the program, which will be dependent on the number and magnitude of the failures. The Competency and Progressions Committee and Vice-Dean and Director of Dentistry will determine if a student is required to repeat a year or withdraw from the DDS program.

If a student is required to repeat the year, they must repeat the entire year. Only in extenuating circumstances will the Vice-Dean and Director of Dentistry grant an exemption.

Supplemental examination privileges are not extended to students repeating a year.

A student granted the privilege of repeating a year will be responsible for all applicable tuition and Dentistry fees outlined in the Fee Schedule of the year being repeated.

Requirement to Withdraw

A student who has not met the requirements listed for “Satisfactory Progression” above or was not successful in demonstrating sufficient achievement and progression after appropriate remediation and/or supplemental examinations shall be required to withdraw from the DDS program for any of the following reasons:

The student has not met the conditions listed under “Conditional Progression” and, therefore is not eligible for supplemental assessment.
The student has met the conditions listed under “Conditional Progression” but permission for supplemental assessment is not granted by the Competency and Progressions Committee and Vice-Dean and Director of Dentistry.
The student is offered and completes a repeat year of supplementary learning and is not successful in progression.

Appeals

Students wishing to appeal a decision of the Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry should refer to the Undergraduate Student Academic Appeals policy.

Readmission

If a student has been asked to withdraw from the DDS Program for unsatisfactory standing, readmission to the Program will be subject to the following conditions:

A student may be permitted to repeat the failed year. Permission to repeat first year is seldom given, and then only under extenuating circumstances. Permission to repeat one of the subsequent years is normally given, but is subject to a vacancy being available in the year to be repeated.
Applications for readmission must be submitted in writing to the Director of Dentistry on or before August 15 of the year in which readmission is being sought.
A student who is granted permission to repeat a year is required to repeat the entire year, regardless of the achievement level. All prescribed work must be completed satisfactorily or the student will be required to withdraw from the Faculty of Dentistry. Supplemental examination privileges are not normally extended to students repeating a year.
A student who voluntarily withdraws from a specific year of instruction before the end of the Fall-Term may apply for readmission to the Vice-Dean and Director of Dentistry by July 1 of the following year. In such event, the year from which the student withdrew would not be counted within the sixty-month period (or forty-eight months for International Dental Graduates) allowed to complete the program.

Grading

Students are able to access their grades at the end of each academic term through the Student Center. The key to grades is:

In the Transition Year (September 1, 2024 to August 31, 2025) 65% to 100% will be a “pass” and below 65% will be a “fail”.

Effective September 1, 2025:

70% and above: Pass
Below 70%: Fail
IPR: Course in Progress
INC: Incomplete

Students must satisfactorily complete all course requirements to receive a Pass level of performance, which includes formative assessments and a minimum grade of 70% (Transition Year – 65%) on summative assessments.

Note: Effective September 1, 2025, the Pass level of performance and minimum grade on summative assessments will change to 70%.

Remedial Work/Supplemental Examination

A grade of 70% (Transition Year – 65%) is given to students who have failed a course and have successfully completed remediation work and/or a supplemental examination.

Honours

See the “Dean’s Honour List and Graduation “With Distinction”” policy.

Graduation Requirements
A student who successfully completes the work of their final year of the DDS program shall be recommended for graduation.

DOCTOR OF MEDICINE (MD) PROGRAM
Program Requirements and Progression
Program Requirements and Progression

The Doctor of Medicine (MD) Program in the Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry is a four-year program. The program is divided into integrated years of learning offering curriculum from large and small group, laboratory, simulated, team and experiential work placed learning.

Year One and Year Two courses involve case-based learning in teams; laboratory experiences in basic and clinical sciences; small group learning; simulation learning; individual independent study; interactive large group learning including team-based learning; lectures; project-based experiential learning and supervised clinical learning experiences. The curriculum is designed to provide foundational learning in the basic and clinical sciences for application in Year 3 and 4 clinical educational experiences. Students are required to complete all course requirements offered including semester-long integrated courses and longitudinal year-long courses.

Year Three is a 52-week single course Clerkship completed as an integrated clerkship where learners serve as active members of clinical care teams in the following medical disciplines: Family Medicine, Medicine, Obstetrics & Gynaecology, Paediatrics, Psychiatry, Anesthesia, Emergency Medicine and Surgery. Within these disciplines there are additional elective learning options. Students learn from and work under the direct supervision of faculty and postgraduate resident physicians. Year 3 students are given graded responsibility in assessment, diagnosis, investigation and management of patient care in acute and chronic care settings, both inpatient and ambulatory, within health care facilities at associated clinical affiliates (hospitals, clinics, physician offices) in London, Windsor and across the distributed education network. Students are assessed in a competency-based process requiring satisfactory achievement of Medical Expert and Professional competencies and no concerns identified in the progression of achievement for the other five core graduation competencies – Communicator, Collaborator, Scholar, Advocate and Leader. Each student learning experience is unique, but each is required to meet rotation and course objectives. Each student in Year Three must complete a Community rural or regional rotation for a minimum of four weeks in the distributed education Southwestern Ontario region.

Year Four is divided into two single term courses consolidating prior learning. Term One Clinical Electives (16 weeks) consists of eight 2-week blocks of primarily clinical educational experiences selected by the student in any area of medicine in line with the expectations for diversification of elective experiences. Students may complete research-based experiences with appropriate notice. Clinical Electives may be completed at the Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, other Canadian medical schools, or in carefully selected international medical schools. Year Four Term Two, Transition to MD (16 weeks) is a mix of independent, small and large group learning ensuring that the knowledge, attitudes, and skills that underpin the required clinical-decision making and problem solving skills for transition to postgraduate medicine education have been achieved.

Program Regulations
Attendance
It is expected that students will attend all scheduled educational experiences.

Attendance is mandatory for sessions as defined in the course syllabus and all clinical learning. Mandatory attendance is required for: all Small Group Learning; Interactive Large Group/Consolidation Learning; Simulation; Clinical learning; Laboratory sessions; project learning, assessments and other sessions as defined in the course syllabus. At the discretion of the Vice Dean or course faculty lead, certain sessions (i.e., collaborative interfaculty learning) may be identified as mandatory. Failure to attend mandatory sessions without prior approval will result in remediation of incomplete learning objectives and assessments. Recurrent failure to attend mandatory learning will be reviewed as a Professionalism breach and will be addressed under MD Program processes and considered as part of progression. Attendance in all clinical and non-clinical learning in Year 3 Clerkship and in Year 4 Clinical Electives is mandatory. Failure to attend scheduled clinical learning in any year will result in remediation of and/or a grade of “Fail” on a rotation, elective or course. The student attendance policy can be found on the MD Program web page.

Professionalism
The MD Program is a professional degree program. The expectations for personal professional behaviour, outlined in the Statement on Professionalism and other School documents, relate to all required curricular learning and any interaction with peers, faculty, staff, patients, families and community. Any breach will be addressed under the Assessment and Appeals Policy and the Statement on Professionalism and may result in a grade of Fail, remediation dismissal.

Immunization
On Admission and for annual clearance, students are required to provide immunization documentation as it relates to COFM Immunization and Screening and Blood Borne Viruses policies and the Schulich Medicine & Dentistry policy on Blood Borne Viruses.

The COFM policy applies to all medical learners (undergraduate medical students and postgraduate residents and fellows) attending an Ontario medical school and performing clinical learning activities in Ontario. Undergraduate medical learners who do not comply with the immunization and health prevention policies may be excluded or suspended from all clinical learning or have the offer of admission rescinded in the interest of patient safety. Medical learners undertaking international clinical learning will require additional assessment, and potentially prophylaxis and immunization against infectious diseases specific to that learning environment. The MD Program, School and Western University International have processes that support safe learning outside Canada and explicit timelines to follow for pre-departure preparation and disease prevention.

Additional immunization may be required by other Canadian clinical sites; the MD Program, School or by provincial mandate in response to a health care outbreak for students in clinical learning during their study in the Program.

Police Checks
Students enrolled in the MD Program are engaged in many areas of patient care, including vulnerable sectors (i.e., infants, children, adolescents, special needs adults, seniors, and patients with mental health conditions) during their learning. To fulfill legal obligations that support patient safety, students will be required to submit their police record checks and vulnerable sector checks upon admission to the Program prior to beginning Year 1 studies and at the beginning of Year 3 and Year 4. These must be completed independently by the learner and submitted to the Learner Experience Office. Students are not permitted to commence their studies in Year 1, Year 3 and Year 4 if they do not submit or update required documentation of a clean police and vulnerable sector check. Students must consult the Admissions Office (for Year 1) and the Learner Experience Office (Years 2,3,4) about processes to follow in the event of a failed check. The Statement on Police Checks for Undergraduate Medical Students is found on the MD program website.

Time Limitation for Completion of the MD Program
The Doctor of Medicine (MD) Program is a full-time, four-year professional academic program. Students on request to the Vice Dean Undergraduate Medical Education may be granted a leave of absence while enrolled in Program studies. The MD program must be completed within six years of the original date of enrolment.

Under no circumstances may (a) a student withdraw and re-enter Program studies or (b) exceed the maximum program length of six years. A student who fails to complete the program in six years, for any reason, must withdraw from the MD Program.

Students enrolled in dual degree programs such as the combined MD-PhD program or MD-MPH (or similar tracks) will require additional years to complete their degrees. It is expected that the maximum time for completion of each dual degree will be adhered to as outlined in the Program syllabus. Failure to comply will result in either withdrawal of enrolment from the dual degree track (without completion of the parallel degree) and/or the MD Program studies.

Assessment
The principal function of student assessment in the MD Program is to provide feedback to support students learning and achievement of competence. All assessment activities are aligned with MD Program graduation competencies and the key competencies at defined stages (i.e. years) to ensure achievement before entering postgraduate medical education.

For the purpose of reporting, and consistent with all English-language Canadian medical school practices, the MD Program standard for progression is a Pass/Fail grade for each course. Percentage grades may be used in specific assessments to provide learner feedback on the achievement of knowledge, skills, attitudes and, progress. Student professionalism throughout all aspects of the curriculum will constitute an essential assessment outcome in each course of the MD Program (see Professionalism above).

Assessment throughout the Program curriculum will involve:

Formative Assessment For Learning: These assessments are designed to monitor student learning, to provide ongoing feedback to students for students to improve learning. This feedback will enable students to identity their strengths and gaps/opportunities and target areas that need attention. Instructors will utilize feedback from formative assessments to recognize where students are struggling and to pre-emptively support student academic success. The assessments may take the form of verbal or written feedback; individual and group assignments; readiness assessments or written and oral examinations.
Summative Assessment of Learning: Summative assessment in each course must be successfully passed for the student to progress to the next level of MD Program study. For these assessments, students may receive a numerical grade, which is a component of the overall course grade reported on the academic transcript as Pass/Fail.
Assessment of Competence: Students will be assessed on their trajectory towards achievement of “entrustability with indirect supervision” on the twelve Association of Faculties of Medicine of Canada (AFMC) Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs) which are tasks of a generalist physician required for graduation. Student professionalism will be assessed throughout the MD Program (see Professionalism above).

During Year 1 and Year 2

Formative Assessment for Learning occurs via group participation; written readiness assessments; reflection; written or oral presentations; peer or other health learner group assessment; individual clinical patient care assessments; coaching; professionalism mentoring and feedback; simulation assessments, laboratory assessments and progress tests.
Summative Assessment of Learning occurs in each course and requires satisfactory completion of all course requirements as outlined in the course syllabus and passing the end-of-course examination.
Assessment of Competence: Students are introduced to EPAs during Clinical Skills and Experiential Learning with expectations relevant to the early stage of training.
During Year 3

Formative Assessment for Learning occurs daily within the Clerkship course as the medical student interacts with patients, families, faculty educators, preceptors, residents and other health professionals in the clinical learning experiences. Assessments may include observed history and physicals, group participation; reflection; written or oral presentations; peer or other multisource feedback; individual clinical patient care assessments; coaching.
Summative Assessment of Learning requires satisfactory achievement on all requirements and occurs at defined points in each Rotation as outlined in the relevant section of the Clerkship syllabus to Pass Clerkship.
Assessment of Competence is integral in Clerkship with assessments in clinical care responsibilities demonstrating a satisfactory developmental trajectory towards achievement of the twelve EPAs. Students are responsible for working with faculty and resident supervisors to obtain assessments throughout their learning activities that demonstrate satisfactory achievement by the completion of Year 3. The Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) assesses students' mastery of the overall objectives of MD Program knowledge, clinical skills, professional conduct and clinical reasoning using simulated clinical settings and must be passed as a requirement for graduation.
During Year 4

Formative Assessment for Learning occurs within a) Clinical Electives as the medical student interacts with patients, families, faculty educators, preceptors, residents and other health professionals in the clinical learning experiences and b) Transition to MD through small group participation, participation in and completion of course requirements, oral and written presentations and peer assessment.
Summative Assessment of Learning in a) Clinical Electives requires satisfactory performance in all 8 elective rotations, including attendance and Professional behaviours and b) Transition to MD through completion of required learning modules; small group participation, assignments and a clinical selective as outlined in the syllabus.
Assessment of Competence occurs in Clinical Electives and Transition to MD electives (where appropriate) with assessments in clinical care demonstrating satisfactory achievement of EPAs. Students are responsible for ensuring they have sufficient assessments that demonstrate satisfactory achievement of the graduation curricular competencies.
Progression
Satisfactory Progression
To satisfactorily complete each year, and to progress to the next year or to graduation, a student must meet the following requirements:

For Year 1 and 2, students must satisfactorily complete all formative assessments and pass all summative assessments in the year, as defined by the Course Chair(s) and outlined in each course syllabus. Students must demonstrate and maintain a level of Professionalism as defined by the Statement on Professionalism.
For Year 3, students must complete all formative assessments and pass each Rotation in Clerkship and successfully complete the OSCE. Students must demonstrate and maintain a level of Professionalism as defined by the Statement on Professionalism.
For Year 4, successful completion of any required remediation for the OSCE is necessary to graduate from the Doctor of Medicine Program. Students must meet all other requirements for Clinical Electives and Transition to MD. Students must demonstrate and maintain a level of Professionalism as defined by the Statement on Professionalism. 
   a. Failure on the OSCE remediation will require a student to undertake additional studies in the MD Program and graduation will be delayed.
For Graduation, students must meet the above requirements for all 4 years of the program. Each student must 1) have satisfactorily achieved the 23 MD Program Graduation Key Competencies that define the knowledge, skills and attitudes expected of graduating Canadian medical students, 2) demonstrate satisfactory achievement of the twelve Association of Faculties of Medicine of Canada (AFMC) Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs), and 3) have demonstrated and maintained a level of Professionalism as defined by the Statement on Professionalism.

Conditional Progression & Remediation or Probation
A student who fails a course; a single rotation in the Clerkship; a Clinical Elective or does not meet the requirements for satisfactory completion as outlined in a course syllabus, may be provided with an opportunity for remediation at the discretion of the Competence Committee in consultation with the course committee and faculty lead. A remediation plan will be required. Remediation of a course, a single rotation in the Clerkship or an elective may only be provided once. A student who does not successfully pass remediation may be required to undergo probation or may be required to withdraw from the program. This may result in repeating a year of the MD Program.

Remediation and or probation plans will be developed for identified gaps and deficiencies in the domains of competence on an individualized basis following a standard process. This includes assignment of a remediation supervisor (assessor) and a mentor (no role in assessment). Remediation and/or probation is monitored by the Competence Committee.


Requirement to Withdraw
A student who has not met the requirements listed for "Satisfactory Progression" above or was not successful in demonstrating sufficient achievement and progression after appropriate remediation and/or probation shall be required to withdraw from the medical program for any of the following reasons:

The student has not met the conditions listed under "Conditional Progression" and, therefore, is not eligible for supplemental assessment.
The student has met the conditions listed under "Conditional Progression" but permission for supplemental assessment is not granted by the Competence Committee.
The student fails a supplemental assessment granted under "Conditional Progression".
The student is offered and completes a repeat year of supplementary learning and is not successful in progression.
The student that has met the requirements under "Satisfactory Progression" may be required to withdraw under the University penalties for Scholastic Offenses or violation of the Western University Code of Student Conduct.
The student has met the requirements under "Satisfactory Progression" but has demonstrated unprofessional or unethical behavior as defined by the Statement on Professionalism or the Policies of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario and the Canadian Medical Association Code of Ethics & Professionalism.
The student has not met the requirements for Immunization and/or Police Record Check/Vulnerable Sector Screening resulting in suspension of clinical privileges and failure to complete academic requirements.
The student has failed to remit tuition or student fees and has been sent to collection, resulting in the suspension of clinical privileges and failure to complete academic requirements.
The student has met the requirements under “Satisfactory Progression” but has not adhered to the “Program Regulations” identified in this document, including (but not limited to) professional conduct.
Appeals
Students wishing to appeal a decision of the Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry should refer to the Assessment and Appeals Statement which is aligned with the Senate Policy on Academic Rights and Responsibilities.

Grading Scales
The criteria for receiving a "Pass" grade will be clearly outlined at the start of each course in the syllabus. The key to this grading scheme is as follows:

PASS – Satisfactory completion of all requirements including formative assessments and a minimum of 70% on summative assessments as outlined in the course syllabus.

CR – Credit

FAIL - Did not meet the minimal acceptable standards and requirements for a specific course including a minimum of 70% on summative assessments as outlined in the course syllabus.

INC – Incomplete

IPR – Course in Progress

Definitions
Competence Committee – A committee made up of faculty members of Schulich Medicine & Dentistry representing various disciplines that reviews each student’s progress. This committee will reference all relevant academic work when reviewing each student’s progress. This committee meets at regular intervals throughout the 4-year curriculum. This committee determines progression of the student and makes recommendations regarding student progression and graduation to the Vice Dean, Undergraduate Medical Education.

EDUCATION - PROGRESSION REQUIREMENTS
Progression Requirements

1. The progress of each Teacher Candidate is subject to formal and informal assessment and evaluation in each of the four academic terms, at every stage of the professional program to determine attainment of experience specific objectives, learning outcomes and professional competencies. 

All candidates registered in the program are expected to be in compliance with Western University’s Degree Level Expectations, and all other applicable policies or statements governed by Western University, including the Code of Student Conduct, MAPP 1.35 – Non-Discrimination/Harassment/Sexual Misconduct Policy, and MAPP 1.46 – Safe Campus Community. In addition, Teacher Candidates must develop and demonstrate the attributes of a professional educator as outlined and regulated in the Ontario College of Teachers’ (OCT) Accreditation standards, the Standards of Professional Practice and Ethical Standards for the Profession, and as administered and assessed in the Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.) program. To remain registered is contingent on maintaining a satisfactory level of performance in all courses and requirements.

Grade reports are tracked and monitored as per Western policy. 

Student progress toward meeting the OCT competencies is documented, monitored and assessed in all components of the program. Candidates document their growth through their Professional Practice Record in their Master Teacher Mentoring groups, under the supervision of a Master Teacher Mentor. Professional Practice Records are reviewed annually by senior leaders in local school boards.

 Progress in the Practicum is documented using an approved Practicum report which must be submitted to the Ontario College of Teachers. If students struggle during practicum, either they or their Associate Teacher will reach out to the Practicum Office, and a Practicum Consultant will be engaged to work with the student and the Associate Teacher. A practicum that is deemed unsuccessful by an Associate Teacher in consultation with a Practicum Consultant will be reported to the Associate Dean, Teacher Education and the student will be placed on Conditional Status. An unsuccessful practicum automatically results in ONE makeup practicum.  

Progress in the Alternative Field Experience is monitored and tracked by the Program Coordinator in the Teacher Education office and supervised by the Alternative Field Experience placement supervisor. An unsuccessful Alternative Field Experience is a decision made between the Supervisor and the Program Coordinator, resulting in a ‘fail’ and will be reported to the Associate Dean, Teacher Education. A student who is unsuccessful in the Alternative Field Experience will be placed on Conditional Status, with ONE opportunity to make up an Alternative Field Experience.  

Progress in the Transition to Professional Practice Professional Development series is tracked by the Program Coordinator. A student who does not attend the requisite sessions is reported to the Associate Dean, Teacher Education, and will be placed on Conditional Status.  

Progress in the Capstone Project is supervised by the Specialty area Faculty member in the course. Like all courses, students who fail to meet the expectations of the course will fail the course, and thus, fail to progress in the program.

2. A Teacher Candidate who fails to maintain a satisfactory level of performance may at any time be Required to Withdraw or be placed on Conditional Status. This decision will be made following a recommendation to the Dean (or Associate Dean) by the Teacher Education Advisory Board.

3. Upon the recommendation of the Teacher Education Advisory Board to the Dean (Associate Dean) a student may be denied a school placement for either a practicum or another purpose related to the B.Ed.

4. Reasons for Withdrawal, Conditional Status, or denial of school placements will be provided to the student in writing:  

Teacher Candidates who are placed on Conditional Status or denied school placements will be provided with a set of conditions to be met for successful completion of their program.
Teacher Candidates who are required to withdraw will not be considered for readmission until after a hiatus of one full academic year.
Teacher Candidates who withdraw from the program or who are required to withdraw will not retain credit for courses or practica that may have been completed at the time of withdrawal. 
Progression from Term to Term and Graduation

1. All courses and practica in each term must be completed satisfactorily before a Teacher Candidate may progress to each subsequent term of the program. An overall pass is required in course work, with a pass being the equivalent of 76% in all courses.

2. Teacher Candidates who do not complete all requirements in the first two terms satisfactorily, (including the Practicum, Alternative Field Experience (AFE), Transition to Practice (T2P) and in demonstrations of professional suitability) will be withdrawn from the program.

3. Under exceptional circumstances, a Teacher Candidate may be permitted to defer enrollment for the second two terms for one year in order to complete requirements of terms one and two. Such exceptional circumstances will be adjudicated on a case-by-case basis by the Dean (Associate Dean, Teacher Education).

4. All term three and four components of the program (courses, practica, T2P and alternative field experiences) must be completed satisfactorily before a Teacher Candidate can qualify for the B.Ed., and be recommended for certification by the Ontario College of Teachers.

Requirements for Participation in Practicum  

Admission to the B.Ed. program entails admission to the practicum program, provided the following requirements are met:

1. Essential Skills & Abilities Requirement: Teacher Candidates must be able to demonstrate responsibility for the physical safety, psychological health, and educational well-being of students in schools. 

2. Ethical Requirement: Teacher Candidates in Ontario Faculties of Education are Associate Members of the Ontario Teachers Federation and are thereby subject to Ethical Standards for the Teaching Profession of the Ontario College of Teachers1. Teacher Candidates must demonstrate care, respect, trust, and integrity in all interactions with students, parents, other teachers, school personnel, and members of the public.  

3. Police Record Check Requirement: A Police Record Check which includes Vulnerable Position Screening and which is acceptable to the school boards with whom the Faculty of Education works is required before a Teacher Candidate can be placed in a school for a practicum. If information that is unacceptable to school boards appears on a Teacher Candidate’s police record check, that Teacher Candidate will not be able to be placed for a practicum and will be required to withdraw from the program.  

4. Attendance and meeting program component requirements: Teacher Candidates must maintain a satisfactory record of attendance, satisfactory standing in all program requirements. Unexcused absences, non-participation in classes, AFE, T2P, incomplete or unsatisfactory assignments and not demonstrating professional suitability as outlined by the OCT Standards and Ethical Standards of the profession, are all grounds for denying a practicum placement.  

Initial Practicum Placement

Teacher Candidates who meet the requirements outlined above will be assigned an initial practicum placement.

Practicum Progression

A minimum of 80 days of successful practicum is required. Experience at each of the two levels in which a Teacher Candidate seeks certification (primary, junior, intermediate, or senior) is required.  
A Teacher Candidate who receives an unsatisfactory practicum evaluation will be allowed to complete ONE makeup practicum.  
A second unsatisfactory practicum evaluation at any point in the program will result in the Teacher Candidate being withdrawn from the program.  
A fee will be charged for practicum placements beyond 100 days. 
Appeal Process
For more information about the appeal process, consult the Undergraduate Student Academic Appeals policy.

If students are not admitted to their first choice of program, they will be ranked for the other programs in the order of preference indicated.

Transfer
Transfer from one program to another can be done only in consultation with the appropriate Department Chair.  Students will be informed about the program in which they are allowed to register in second year when they access their marks when academic year marks are available.

Progression Requirements
The progress of students shall be evaluated at the end of the academic year. Eligibility to progress shall be based on the performance of the student during the evaluation period as indicated by the weighted average obtained for that period.

The progression requirements for Engineering students registered in an approved concurrent/combined degree program will be based only on those courses being counted toward the Bachelor of Engineering Science (BESc) degree.

To be eligible for the concurrent degree, students must meet the progression requirements of each Faculty.

Progression Requirements for Part-Time Students
A part-time student will be adjudicated once the student has completed 3.0 or more courses since the last adjudication. The weighted average will be calculated on all courses completed since the last adjudication. The progression adjudication will be effective over all the courses used in the adjudication.

BESc Degree and Minor Modules
Prior to registering for courses to be used toward a Minor, students registered in the Faculty of Engineering, BESc degree, must obtain approval from their Academic Advisor. Not all combinations between the BESc discipline and the choice of Minor may be approved. If the courses selected toward a Minor qualify as non-technical electives, they may also be used toward the student’s non-technical electives for the BESc degree.

Students registered in Combined Degree programs within the Faculty of Engineering are not eligible to add a Minor module to their BESc degree.

Time Limit for Completion of BESc Degree
The Faculty of Engineering requires that all undergraduate students complete the program of study within 10 years from the start of their first registration in Western Engineering.  The time limit for completion ensures that all graduates have demonstrated sufficient knowledge of up-to-date technology, engineering concepts, and professional practice.

Definition of Terms
Course Weight
Each course has been assigned a weight of 0.5 (half-course), 1.0 (full course). All A, B, F, G, and Y courses are half-courses. Courses with the suffix E or without a suffix are full courses.  The weights for courses offered by other faculties are usually either 1.0 (full course) or 0.5 (half-course).

Weighted Mark
The weighted mark for a course is the product of the weight for the course and the mark obtained by the student.  

For the purpose of calculating weighted average marks the following applies: grades below 40% will be included in average calculations as 40%; grades from 40% to 100% will be included as the actual grade reported.

Weighted Average
The weighted average for an evaluation period is the total of the weighted marks obtained by the student during the evaluation period divided by the sum of the weights for the corresponding courses.

Dean’s Honour List and Graduation “With Distinction”
See the “Dean’s Honour List and Graduation “With Distinction”” Policy.

Progression in Good Standing, Conditional Progression
Progression in Good Standing  
A student who, at the end of an academic year, has achieved a weighted average of at least 60% and has achieved a passing grade in each course of their approved program shall proceed to the next year in Good Standing.

Conditional Progression
A student who, at the end of an academic year, has achieved a weighted average of at least 60% but has failed to pass one or more courses, may proceed to the next year on condition that the failed course(s) are repeated or approved substitutions are taken during the next Fall/Winter Session.

Exam Deferrals
If a student fails to write a scheduled examination, permission for a special examination will be granted only by the Dean (or designate) in exceptional circumstances and with appropriate supporting documents. If the student needs to defer the special examination, permission will be granted again only by the Dean (or designate) and with appropriate supporting documents. In this case, the examination can be written at its next regular sitting and the maximum course load for that term will be reduced by the number of credits of the course(s) for which the final examination has been deferred. Final examinations for any course cannot be deferred more than three times and the last attempt must be within 13 months of the date of the original scheduled final examination. After missing the original final examination and the three deferred special examinations, the student will either receive a grade of zero for the final examination or, if documentation justifies the absences, may be granted a retroactive withdrawal (WDN) from the course. The course needs to be retaken after three consecutive examination deferrals.

Failed Year, Failed Courses
Failed Year for Upper Year Students
A student who is in second, third or fourth year and who for the first time obtains a weighted average at the end of the academic year in the range of 50-59% shall be considered to have failed the year. Credit shall be retained in the Faculty of Engineering for courses in which the student obtains a mark of 60% or better in that year. This requirement will apply to any courses taken during the subsequent summer term.

Students with an average in the range of 50-59% will be considered on probation. Students on probation are required to satisfy the requirements of the Conditions of Probation as follows:

The student must seek the advice of the Academic Advisor(s).
The student will be permitted to take a maximum of 2.0 courses during the Spring/Summer session and a maximum of 4.0 during the Fall/Winter session, and may be required to take fewer courses by their Dean (or designate) as part of the academic probation.
Academic probation will begin immediately upon official notification from the Office of the Registrar and will not end prior to the first adjudication period at which a minimum of 3.0 course credits have been attempted.

Notification is defined as one or more of:

1) a letter mailed to the student’s home address;
2) an email sent to the student’s official Western email account;
3) a notice posted to the Student Center where student grades are posted.

A student on academic probation must achieve a YWA average of at least 60% with no failures on all courses taken during the probation period.

If a minimum of 3.0 course credits have not been attempted at the first adjudication period following the start of the probation, this period will be extended automatically until the student will attempt 3.0 course credits.

A student who fails a course during probation or its extension will be required to withdraw at the next adjudication period regardless of the number of courses attempted since the last adjudication.

A student will be allowed only one period of probation and only one probation extension during the course of their degree. A student will be required to withdraw if either the cumulative average or probation conditions are not met during this extended probation period.

A student who fails to meet the Conditions of Probation will be required to withdraw from the Faculty of Engineering for a minimum of 12 months.

Failed Courses
Students who are required to repeat an Engineering course must repeat all components of that course.  No special permissions will be granted enabling the student to retain laboratory, assignment or test marks from prior years. Previously completed assignments and laboratories cannot be resubmitted for grading by the student in subsequent years.

A student registered in the Faculty Engineering who has failed a Fall term half course (September to December) may not repeat the course in the Winter term (January to April) of the same academic year.

Withdrawal for Unsatisfactory Standing
A student shall be required to withdraw from the Faculty of Engineering and (unless admitted to another Faculty) shall be required to withdraw from the University, if that student:

a) is in the first year of the program and fails to obtain a weighted average of at least 60%; or
b) is in a year of the program subsequent to the first year and fails to obtain a weighted average of at least 50% at the end of the academic year; or
c) has failed for a second time to obtain a weighted average of at least 60% at the end of the academic year; or
d) has been readmitted after withdrawal for unsatisfactory standing and obtains a weighted average of less than 60% at the end of the academic year, in any year.

Appeals
A student who has been withdrawn for unsatisfactory standing may appeal. See the policy on “Undergraduate Student Academic Appeals”.
Note: Students may appeal decisions in writing to the Dean of the Faculty (or designate) by June 30 of the year of application.

Students of any year who are granted a Dean’s Waiver to be re-admitted into the Faculty of Engineering will be subjected to the conditions listed in the Failed Year for Upper Students. 

Readmission Following Withdrawal for Unsatisfactory Standing
A student who has been required to withdraw because of unsatisfactory standing, who did not apply for or who was not granted a Dean’s Waiver, may apply for readmission through the Admissions Office following a period of at least one year outside the University.

Transfer to Another Faculty
1. A student who is eligible to continue in the Engineering program yet wishes to transfer to another Faculty may do so provided the approval of the Dean of the Faculty to which the transfer is desired has been obtained.
2. A student who has been required to withdraw from the University by the Faculty of Engineering may apply for readmission to the University in another Faculty through the Dean’s Office of the desired Faculty by June 30.

Supplemental Examinations
A student in the final year who has applied to graduate at Spring Convocation may be granted supplemental examination privileges provided that the student has earned:

1. a failing grade in not more than one full or two half-courses;
2. a mark of at least 40% in the failed course(s);
3. a weighted average of at least 60% in the courses that make up the fourth-year program (including the failed courses); and  
4. an overall average of at least 60% in all the courses that are required for the BESc degree. 

Permission to write supplemental examinations will be granted only after the academic results for the students in their final year have been reviewed by the Faculty at a meeting held during the month of May.

These examinations will be scheduled during the examination period for Intersession.*

Supplemental examination privileges apply only to courses offered by the Faculty of Engineering.

*Note: The original grade obtained by the student will not be changed; rather, a Summer Line of Registration with the course and a grade of PAS or FAI will be added to the Academic Record upon the completion of the Supplemental Examination.

Graduation Requirements
A candidate for the BESc degree shall pass all courses in the candidate's approved program of studies and obtain a weighted average of at least 60% in the courses that make up the fourth-year program together with a weighted average of at least 60% in all the courses in all years which are counted for graduation.

Graduate Courses
Students in the final year of the Engineering program who have achieved a cumulative weighted average of at least 80% as well as a year weighted average of 80% in the penultimate year may, with the permission of their Academic Advisor, the course instructor, and the Vice-Provost (Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies), include in the program of the final year up to one full graduate course that will count towards the undergraduate degree.

Note:
For the current requirements for Engineering programs please refer to the current Academic Calendar.

FACULTY OF REGISTRATION
First-year students normally will be enrolled in a First Year program in their Faculty of Registration e.g. Arts and Humanities, Health Sciences, Information and Media Studies, Engineering, Music, Science, Social Science and Affiliated University Colleges.

In subsequent years, normal entrance requirements apply for placement in modules and programs. The essential module(s) for the degree will determine the Faculty of Registration. However, for students enrolled in Year 2 in Basic Medical Sciences modules leading to a BMSc degree, registration is in the Faculty of Science. For students enrolled in Years 3 and 4 in Basic Medical Sciences modules leading to a BMSc degree, registration is in the Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry. Students registered in Double Majors or Double Minors that include modules offered by two different Faculties in Arts and Humanities, Science or Social Science must choose one of the two Faculties as their Faculty of Registration. Students registered in Double Majors or Double Minors that include modules offered by one of certain Faculties such as Health Science or Information and Media Studies must register in that Faculty.

NURSING - PROGRESSION REQUIREMENTS
Western-Fanshawe Collaborative BScN Program and Compressed Time Frame BScN Program
Program
Enrolment in non-Nursing courses is limited and in some cases demand exceeds that limit. The University is unable to guarantee registration in any particular course and reserves the right to withdraw course offerings.

The Western-Fanshawe Collaborative and Compressed Time Frame Programs offer Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BScN) programs that qualify graduates to apply to write the NCLEX-RN and subsequently register as a professional nurse with the College of Nurses of Ontario.

The Western-Fanshawe Collaborative BScN program is offered collaboratively by Western University and Fanshawe College of Applied Arts and Technology. The first two years of the program are offered at both institutions. All students complete years 3 and 4 at the Western site. Program requirements are the same at both sites.

The Compressed Time Frame (CTF) Nursing Program allows students to complete a BScN degree in five consecutive terms if enrolled in the CTF Regular Stream or the RPN Stream A, otherwise if enrolled in the RPN Stream B the program is completed in six consecutive terms. 

Progression Requirements
Students may proceed to the next year of their program if the following conditions are met:

• A PASS is required in clinical application courses.
• A passing grade of at least 65% in Nursing theory courses.
• A passing grade of at least 60% in in the following courses: Physiology 1020, Nursing 1330A/B, Nursing 2440A/B, Nursing 3820A/B, Pharmacology 2060A/B.
• A passing grade of at least 50% in all elective courses.

A student whose year average is below 65% may not proceed to the next year/level of the program until the average has been raised to 65% or above.

A maximum of 2.0 full course equivalent credit (FCE) failures are permitted throughout the program.

Failed Nursing courses may be repeated only once. Students who fail a theory or clinical application course will be required to repeat the corequisite theory/clinical application course.

Progression: Clinical Application Collaborative Evaluation
Components of a clinical application course include practice, laboratory and/or simulated professional practice and written work. Professional practice courses are graded as:

Satisfactory (S) - Satisfactory performance in relation to the course goals

Unsatisfactory (U) - Unsatisfactory performance in any of the course goals

Needs Development (ND) - Used at midterm evaluation to identify performance in any of the course goals requiring focused attention

In order for students to achieve satisfactory clinical application performance, they are required to:

Complete the Pre-Placement Requirements for clinical application agencies by date specified prior to course start;
Meet all course goals;
Keep appointments with assigned clients, families and faculty;
Advise appropriate people of inability to keep appointments in a timely manner;
Attend classes, seminars, clinical application experiences, tutorials, simulation and laboratories;
Notify the Academic Advisor (Western), Year 1 or 2 coordinator (Fanshawe), clinical instructor and clinical application agency/unit prior to any absence or late arrival;
Be prepared for all clinical application assignments;
Adhere to/comply with all professional Guidelines and Standards of Practice of the College of Nurses of Ontario;
• Successfully meet all requirements of the Collaborative Success Plan (CSP) if applicable.
Unacceptable Clinical Application 
Behaviors leading to unacceptable clinical application place students, the institution and/or its clients at risk. Examples include but are not limited to:

Lack of judgment, knowledge or skill;
Unprofessional comments or conduct;
Inadequate preparation;
Abuse of the position of trust;
Unsafe practice;
Violation of confidentiality and/or privacy.
NOTE: It is strictly forbidden that any audio/video/photographic images be taken in any clinical application setting, including lab and simulation for any reason.

Any student who exhibits signs or behaviours that jeopardize the welfare of the client or agency will be asked to leave the agency. Any instance of unacceptable practice will be reported to the Associate Director, Undergraduate Programs (Western) or the Chair of the Collaborative BScN program (Fanshawe College). Removal from any clinical application course may result in a course failure and/or withdrawal from the program.

Failure to Meet Progression Requirements
Students who fail to meet progression requirements are advised to contact the following individuals regarding continuation in the program:

Western collaborative students and Western CTF students: Academic Advisors, Arthur Labatt Family School of Nursing

Fanshawe site students: Year Coordinator

Academic Handbook, Registration, Progression Programs - Nursing

PROGRESSION FOLLOWING ADMISSION WITH TRANSFER CREDIT (ADVANCED STANDING)
To qualify for a Bachelor Degree, a transfer student must obtain credit in a minimum of 5.0 senior courses in a 15.0 course Bachelor Degree (Three-Year), or 10.0 course Bachelor Degree (Four-Year) or an Honours Bachelor Degree (Four-Year). These courses must be taken through Western or an Affiliated University College. Students admitted with transfer credit (advanced standing) to a specific program of study must meet the progression and graduation requirements for that program. Progression following admission with transfer credit (advanced standing) will be normally according to Level 1 or Level 2 progression requirements, or according to discretionary requirements established by the appropriate Admissions Office.

Academic Handbook, Registration, Registration and Progression

 

PROGRESSION FOLLOWING READMISSION
Progression following readmission will be according to Level 1 or Level 2 progression requirements or according to discretionary requirements established by the appropriate Admissions Office.

Students who fail to maintain satisfactory academic standing in any year subsequent to readmission will not usually be readmissible to the university for a second time.

Academic Handbook, Registration, Registration and Progression

 

PROGRESSION REQUIREMENTS
Progression Requirements
Progression Requirements are designed to assist a student in improving their grades over time so that they may attain the required average for graduation or for entrance to and continuation in honours or other specialized programs. Progression requirements establish the minimum requirements for a student to continue at the University but the expectation is that a student will aspire to excellence and seek to achieve results well above the minimum requirements for their program.

Adjudication
The Adjudication Process involves the assessment of a student's eligibility to progress at the University and/or enter or remain in a program. As part of the adjudication process, progression requirements will be checked twice a year during two adjudication periods: the May adjudication period based on marks obtained during the Fall/Winter term (for the September - December and January - April sessions) and the July-August adjudication period based on marks obtained during the Summer term (Intersession, Summer Evening and Summer Day sessions). Student records for those registered for the term are evaluated/adjudicated to ascertain if a student meets the progression requirements: (a) to remain in good standing at the University, (b) of their current program, and/or (c) for entrance to another proposed program in which they have indicated an Intent to Register.

Average Calculation for progression requirements includes both a term (sessional) and a cumulative average for all applicable courses. Average calculations INCLUDE failed grades. All grades below 50% are considered failures. Grades below 40% will be included in average calculations as 40%, grades from 40% to 49% will be included as the actual grade reported.

A Course Attempt is a course registration that is not dropped by the Last day to drop deadline date in the Undergraduate Sessional Dates in the Academic Calendar (the latest, including all revisions, will be found on the Office of the Registrar web site). The Last day to drop will vary according to type of course: full course, first term half course, full year half course, and second term half course. A course that is dropped by the last date for adding a course will be removed from a student's record. A course that is dropped after the last date for adding a course but before the final day for dropping a course will be recorded as WDN (withdrawn) and is not considered a course attempt. A course that is dropped after the final day for dropping a course will be recorded as F (failure) and will receive a mark of 40% for Average Calculation purposes.

A Course Repeat is any course previously attempted and recorded at Western University. A course attempt having a passing grade may be repeated only once. A course attempt having a failing grade may be repeated only twice. Further course repeats may be authorized only by the Dean of the Faculty in which the student is registered. Grades (including failures) for all course attempts will appear on the transcript and will be included in the accumulation of course attempts and maximum failures allowed. All but the most recent course attempt will appear on the transcript as Repeated, No credit and will be excluded from cumulative average calculations used for progression requirements.

In Good Standing
In Good Standing - a student who satisfies the minimum progression requirements for continuation of study will be eligible to continue at Western University.

On Probation
On Probation - a student who does not satisfy the minimum progression requirements for continuation of study at Western University but who will be allowed to continue at the University under Conditions of Probation:

A student must seek the advice of the Academic Counsellor(s) in their Home Faculty.

A student will be permitted to take a maximum number of 2.0 courses during the Summer sessions and a maximum of 4.0 during the Fall/Winter sessions and may be required to take fewer courses by their Dean as part of the academic probation.

Academic probation will begin immediately upon official notification from the Office of the Registrar, and will not end prior to the first adjudication period at which a minimum of 3.0 course credits have been attempted.

Notification is defined as one or more of:

1) A letter mailed to a student’s home address;
2) An email sent to a student’s official Western email account;
3) A notice posted to the Student Centre where student grades are posted.

A student on academic probation must achieve an average of at least 60% with no failures, on all courses taken during the probation period.

If the conditions of probation have been met as of the first adjudication period at which a minimum of 3.0 courses have been attempted and the cumulative average remains below 60%, the probation period will be extended automatically until the first adjudication period at which a minimum of 3.0 additional courses have been attempted.

A student who fails a course during a period of probation or probation extension will be required to withdraw at the next adjudication period regardless of the number of courses attempted since their last adjudication.

A student will be allowed only one period of probation in the time taken to complete a degree; and only one probation extension. A student will be required to withdraw if either the cumulative average or probation conditions are not met during this extended probation period.

A student who fails to meet the Conditions of Probation will be required to withdraw from the University for a minimum of twelve months.

Required to Withdraw
Required to Withdraw - a student who does not satisfy the minimum Progression Requirements for continuation of study at Western University and is not eligible for probation or who has exceeded the maximum number of failed courses allowed, 6.0 courses, will be Required to Withdraw from the University for a minimum of twelve months. A student who has been Required to Withdraw from the University and whose academic standing has been jeopardized by serious medical or personal difficulties may, if they have sought academic accommodation in a timely manner, apply for a Dean's Waiver of Progression Requirements. A student granted a Dean's Waiver of Progression Requirements must meet the specific conditions imposed in the Dean's Waiver. For a student who has been required to withdraw, readmission will be at the discretion of the appropriate Admissions Office. See READMISSION FOLLOWING UNSATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE section.

Should an appeal be made to Senate on the ruling of a Dean, such an appeal shall be considered on behalf of Senate by the Senate Review Board Academic (SRBA). See STUDENT ACADEMIC APPEALS section.

A student’s failure to read a notification is not grounds to appeal academic probation or Required to Withdraw.

Level 1 and 2 progression requirements
Two levels of progression requirements are used to assess a student's Academic Standing Status :

Level 1 progression requirement:
A minimum cumulative average of 55% must be obtained at the first adjudication period at which the student has completed a minimum of 3.0 course attempts. If a student has completed more than 3.0 courses at the time of adjudication, marks from all courses taken will be used to calculate the cumulative average. This minimum cumulative average must be maintained for each successive adjudication period until the student reaches Level 2*.

Students who satisfy this requirement will be eligible to continue study In Good Standing. Students with a cumulative average from 50-54% will continue On Probation. Students with a cumulative average less than 50% will be Required to Withdraw.

Level 2 progression requirement:
A minimum cumulative average of 60% must be obtained at the first adjudication period at which the student has completed a minimum of 8.0 course attempts completed through Western University or through one of its Affiliated University Colleges. If a student has completed more than 8.0 courses at the time of adjudication, marks from all courses taken will be used to calculate the cumulative average. This minimum cumulative average must be maintained for each successive adjudication period until the student graduates*.

Students who satisfy this requirement will be eligible to continue study In Good Standing. Students with a cumulative average from 55-59% will continue On Probation. Students with a cumulative average less than 55% will be Required to Withdraw.

Maximum number of failures allowed is 6.0 courses.

* Note: Averages required for graduation may differ. Averages required on an overall program and module will not be less than 60%, and will be higher for some three-year and four-year programs and all honours programs.

Students registered in a Fall/Winter Session, who have applied to register for courses in subsequent Intersession or Summer Evening Session but whose ineligibility for further registration has not yet been determined by the first day of classes, will be permitted to complete any such course(s). Although credit will be retained for courses completed successfully, such credit will not alter ineligibility for further registration. Any such student, required to withdraw for failure to achieve the minimum progression requirements, will not become eligible for further registration before the Summer Day Session in the subsequent year.

Academic Handbook, Registration, Registration and Progression

PROGRESSION REQUIREMENTS - LAW
The Academic Session
The Academic Session at the Faculty of Law comprises a period of approximately thirty weeks: the session is divided into two terms. (See Faculty of Law - Sessional Dates)

The timetable for the first term is available in the Administrative Office on the first day of classes. The Faculty may, on notice, schedule compulsory classes and seminars additional to those indicated on the timetable.

Attendance
Success in law studies requires that students devote their full time to the work of the school. The Faculty advises all students to avoid outside employment unless absolutely necessary.

No credit is allowed for work done in absentia. Leave of absence is not permitted except in unusual circumstances. Students in good standing who are permitted to withdraw can rejoin the Faculty of Law subject to the regulations in force at the time they apply to re-enter. Failure to attend classes, seminars, appointments or examinations without good cause constitutes a ground for exclusion from the Faculty.

The right to sit for examinations or to submit work for evaluation is conditional upon regular class attendance and participation in required exercises. An instructor, with the approval of the Associate Dean (Academic), may refuse to evaluate all or part of a student's work where attendance has not been regular.

Permission to Register in Individual Courses
A student registered in another faculty at Western may, upon application, be granted permission to register in one full or equivalent course offered by the Faculty of Law. Such registration occurs at the discretion of the student's dean and the dean of the Faculty of Law. Students granted such permission will be granted in the same way as regular students in the course; however, they can obtain no credit toward a Bachelor of Laws degree in this manner.

Evaluation
Course descriptions must set out clearly the contents of the course and the method of evaluation. These may not be changed after they have been published without the instructor's and students' agreement.

Instructors should be as specific as possible about the method of evaluation. While it may not be essential to indicate whether an examination is open or closed book, it is preferable to provide students with this information at the outset of the course.

In upper-year courses, a final examination may count for more than 75% of a student's final grade only if the student (i) has been given the option of a final examination worth 75% or less, and (ii) has declined that option. First-year courses (with the exception of Legal Research, Writing and Advocacy, Corporate Law and Legal Ethics and Professionalism) run the full academic year, with mid-term examinations held in December worth at least 20% and not more than 30% of the student’s final grade in the course. Questions included in first-year December examinations cannot be released to students prior to the day after classes end in the fall term.

The Faculty uses a system of anonymous marking, and students are issued exam numbers each term. These numbers are the only identification used by students on examination papers. They may also be used for other methods of evaluation.

No more than 75% of a student's final grade in a course may be assessed on the basis of group work. This rule does not apply to a research paper undertaken as a joint Individual Research project for which a group of students has received approval. 'Group work' means an assignment submitted by two or more students for which there is a single overall evaluation with one common mark allotted to all students in the group.

No more than 20% of the final grade in a course may be for class participation. The basis for the participation component must be clearly stated.

A student who has an unexcused absence from an examination, or an unexcused failure to submit an assignment or complete a course component, will receive an F for the examination, assignment or course component.

Grading Rules
The Faculty of Law uses the following grade designations:

 Grades	 Grade Meaning	 Numeric Values
 A+

 Excellent

 90-100%

 A

 Excellent

 85-89%

 A-

Students receive only a letter grade for each subject. The numeric values are used for letter grade calculation only.

The "PAS" and "FAI" designations are used only in courses identified specifically as being graded on a pass/fail basis. This pass/fail designation is used also for grades obtained on exchanges. A grade of "FAI" is treated the same as an "F" grade.

In any course not identified specifically as being graded on a pass/fail basis, no components of any student's grade in the course can be assessed on a pass/fail basis.

The class average in an upper-year course of 25 or fewer students must be between 74.0 – 79.0. The class average in an upper-year course of more than 25 students and in all first year courses must be between 74.0 – 76.0. Grades in the “F” range will be excluded from the calculation of class averages. These grading rules do not apply to independent research projects, supplemental writing credits, courses in which students participate in external advocacy competitions, or to internships or externships with fewer than five enrolled students.

For the purposes of calculating class averages and the overall average of individual students, including the determination of Honours standing, final letter grades for each student are assigned the following fixed numeric values:


 Grades	 Fixed Numeric Value
 A+	 92
 A	 87
 A-	 82
 B+	 78
 B	 75
 B-	 71
 C+	 68
 C	 65
 C-	 61
 D	 58
 F	 45

Individual grades assigned by instructors remain provisional until they are approved at the Faculty of Law Grades Meeting. The grades assigned by instructors must comply with the applicable class average requirements and must be submitted, together with electronic evidence demonstrating such compliance, in the form stipulated by the Assistant Dean, Student Services. However, after grades have been assigned, the Faculty has the discretion, at a Faculty of Law grades meeting, to waive the class average requirements. If an instructor wishes to seek an exemption from the class average requirements, the instructor must apply to the Faculty at a Grades Meeting, supplying the reasons for the application and the recommended non-compliant grades along with an alternative set of compliant grades.

In the case of a class with fewer than six students, an instructor who has submitted non-compliant grades is not required to submit at the same time an alternative set of compliant grades.



Supplemental Assessments
A student who has failed a course is normally entitled to write a supplemental assessment to attempt to obtain credit for the course.

A student is not entitled to write a supplemental assessment if:

1. The student obtained, prior to writing any supplemental assessment, more than one grade of F in first year or more than one grade of F in any single term of an upper year;

2. The student failed to demonstrate a reasonable or good faith effort to fulfill the academic requirements of the failed course; or

3. The grade of F in the course was attributable, in whole or in part, to the commission of a scholastic offence, as defined by university policy on scholastic offences, and the Associate Dean (Academic) has determined through that policy that the student should not be entitled to write a supplemental assessment.

If an instructor alleges that a student failed to demonstrate a reasonable or good faith effort to fulfill the academic requirements of a failed course, the Associate Dean (Academic) shall determine whether the allegation is valid. Before making a final determination, the Associate Dean (Academic) shall first give the failing student notice of the allegation, including the reasons for it, and provide the student a reasonable opportunity to explain how the student did demonstrate a reasonable and good faith effort.

A student who fails a course and is not entitled to write a supplemental assessment receives a final grade of F in the course.

A student who is entitled to write a supplemental assessment but does not do so receives a final grade of F in the course.

A student who is entitled to write a supplemental assessment must obtain a minimum grade of C on the assessment to pass and thereby obtain credit for the course. If the student obtains a C or better on the assessment, the original grade of F remains on the transcript with a notation that the course has been “passed by supplemental”. If the student does not obtain a C or better on the supplemental assessment, the student receives a final grade of F in the course.

Normally, a supplemental assessment will take the same form as the original assessment. However, it is within the instructor's discretion to select another form of supplemental assessment.

Progression
Unless granted permission by the Associate Dean (Academic), a student is not entitled to take any additional courses before successfully completing all of the following courses: Constitutional Law; Contracts; Criminal Law; Legal Research, Writing and Advocacy; Property; Torts; and either Corporate Law or Legal Ethics and Professionalism.

Unless given academic accommodation, a student must enrol in enough courses to meet the minimum term and annual credit requirements stipulated in the Faculty’s Academic Program. A student who fails to meet the minimum credit requirements of a given term or year for reasons other than failing a course must spend the next term only making up the missing credits. In that next term, the student is only entitled to enrol in the minimum number of courses necessary to make up the missing credits. No additional courses can be taken until after the missing credits have been earned.

Excluding any approved leave of absence and subject to the discretion of the Associate Dean (Academic), a student who fails to enrol in any courses during a summer course bidding period and during any of the following 375 days is, upon notice to the student, deemed to have withdrawn from the Juris Doctor program. A summer course bidding period is the period designated by the Faculty each year when students are entitled to use bid points to select courses.

A student earns no credit for any course in which the student receives a final grade of F. A failed course for which a student receives no credit does not fulfill any Law program requirements. If the student is entitled to remain enrolled in the Faculty, the student must make up any missing credits in a later term designated by the Associate Dean (Academic). The student is only required to make up credits to the extent necessary to meet, after the fact, the minimum credit requirements for the term and year in which the student obtained the final grade of F.

A student who obtains a final grade of F in a course in the winter term of third-year, and who is entitled to remain enrolled in the Faculty, may return in a fourth year to make up the missing credits. The student is only entitled to take a maximum of two courses. The course or courses must be taken in the fall term.

A student who obtains a final grade of F in a course, and who is entitled to remain enrolled in the Faculty, is normally permitted, but not required, to re-take the failed course in a later term. In appropriate circumstances, the Associate Dean (Academic) may deny such permission.

Continuing Enrolment
Continuing enrolment in the Faculty of Law is conditional on a student demonstrating sufficient academic competence. A student will be required to withdraw from the Faculty in any of the following situations:

1. Over the course of a student’s enrolment in the Faculty, the student accumulates any of the following combinations of final grades:

a. Two or more grades of F;

b. One grade of F plus two or more grades of D;

c. One grade of F plus, collectively, three or more grades of D and/or C-;

d. Collectively, five or more grades of D and/or C-.

2. A student obtains a final grade of F in any compulsory course.

For greater certainty,

1. A compulsory course is any course specified in the Faculty’s Academic Program as one that a student must take;

2. In a pass/fail course, a fail will be considered a final grade of F and a pass will not count as a grade of F, D or C-;

3. A student shall be deemed not to have obtained a final grade of F, D or C- in a course if the student initially receives a failing grade but later passes the course by supplemental assessment.

Before requiring a student to withdraw, the Associate Dean (Academic) shall arrange for a review of all final grades of C- or lower in all courses taken by the student. This review will include rereading of all the student’s examination papers to verify the accuracy of the marking process. Despite the above, the Dean may grant a student who is required to withdraw permission to remain enrolled, subject to any conditions the Dean deems appropriate. Before making a final decision, the Dean shall first inform the student of the outcome(s) of the aforementioned review and give the student an opportunity to explain why the student should be permitted to remain enrolled.

Prerequisites
A student may not take a course for which there is a prerequisite if the final grade obtained in the prerequisite was an F.

Process
The Faculty of Law uses the Gradebook in OWL to record grades.  It is the responsibility of all instructors to enter their students' final grades and, for first year full-year courses, their students' mid-term examination grades into this program.

The deadline for entering grades is: (a) in courses with a final examination, one week following the writing of the examination; and (b) in courses without a final examination, one week after the last day of classes.

An instructor does not have the authority to unilaterally change a students' final grade after it has been submitted to the Students Services Office. However, if an instructor discovers a mathematical or other technical error in a grade that has been submitted, the instructor should contact the Student Services Office as soon as possible to officially record the appropriate grade.

The Faculty has the right to alter course grades at the grades meeting. The Dean or Associate Dean (Academic) will alert an instructor if the instructor's grades appear to be anomalous and may seek an explanation.


Faculty of Law: Winter Term Format
The Winter Term for first year students begins with a period of intensive instruction. During this period students enrolled in first year will work exclusively in small groups developing research, writing, and advocacy skills. Students will fulfill their remaining course requirements for the year during the Winter Term.

Honours
A student who achieves an average of at least "B" on a full year's work as defined by the program and who is in the top 10% of the class, is named to the Dean's Honour List.

Students in any year who attend another law school on a letter of permission from Western and students in any year who attend the Faculty of Law on a letter of permission from another law school, are not considered for the Dean's Honour List in that year.
Only the grades earned in courses taken at the Faculty of Law in a particular year (provided those courses total at least 14 credit hours) are used to calculate a student's standing for an overall achievement award in that year.

A student who is on the Dean's Honour List for at least two of the three years at the Faculty of Law and who obtains a cumulative average of at least "B" over the three years shall graduate With Distinction.

The winner of awards or prizes for the highest marks in a particular subject will be determined without regard to whether the student has received other prizes or awards.


Appeal Procedures
Please refer to the Faculty of Law website, www.law.uwo.ca.


For related information, refer to the STUDENT ACADEMIC APPEALS - UNDERGRADUATE section.

Academic Program
In first year, students take the following courses: Constitutional Law; Contracts; Criminal Law; Legal Research, Writing and Advocacy; Property; Torts; and either Corporate Law or Legal Ethics and Professionalism.

Students in their second and third years must take fourteen to sixteen course credit hours in each term, with a minimum of twenty-nine hours and a maximum of thirty-one hours in the two terms combined; students may take more than thirty-one credit hours only with the permission of the Associate Dean (Academic).

Students must, after first year, take Civil Procedure and Administrative Law.  In second year, students must take whichever of Corporate Law or Legal Ethics and Professionalism that they did not complete in first year. 

By the end of third year, a student must satisfy the Faculty writing requirements. Students may satisfy the Faculty writing requirements in either of two ways, namely: (1) by completing in upper year courses two research essays, each worth at least two credits, or (2) by completing in upper year courses one research essay worth at least two credits and one or more practice-oriented legal writing assignments worth at least two credits collectively.

A practice-oriented legal writing assignment must involve independent legal research and/or analysis. To provide some examples, a factum or legal memo will generally count as a practice-oriented legal writing assignment, while a research essay worth less than two credits or a reflective journal will not.

A Supplemental Writing Credit may count towards fulfilling the Faculty writing requirements. Specifically, a student can complete the requirements for a research essay worth at least two credits by adding a Supplemental Writing Credit to a course assessed in part by a research essay (worth at least one but less than two credits), if the Supplemental Writing Credit is used to extend the research essay. A Supplemental Writing Credit can count toward completing a practice-oriented legal writing assignment if the Supplement Writing Credit is attached to a course that already includes a practice-oriented legal writing assignment.

In all cases, the Associate Dean (Academic) has the final authority to decide whether a component of a course will satisfy a Faculty writing requirement.

Note: In each of second and third years, a student may take courses outside the Law School up to the equivalent of six credit hours, but no more than four such hours in any one semester. The approval of the course instructor and the Associate Dean (Academic) of the Faculty of Law must be obtained.


Cross-Registration in Business Courses
The Faculty of Law and the Ivey Business School have a joint arrangement whereby second and third-year law students and MBA students may cross register in courses offered by the other Faculty or School. Students must obtain approval from both the Associate Dean of the school in which they are registered and the student services office of the school offering the course(s) they wish to attend. Such students are expected to meet all requirements of the course. Grades for Law students taking courses at the Ivey Business School will be recorded on their university academic records on the 100-point grading scale.

JD/HBA Combined Degree Program
Structure of the Program
The combined program is administered on behalf of the Ivey Business School and the Faculty of Law by the two HBA/JD Program Directors, one of whom is appointed by the Ivey Business School and the other by the Faculty of Law. The combined program allows students to complete both the JD and HBA degrees in six academic years instead of the seven years that would be required if the degrees were taken separately. 

Students are registered in the combined program for Years Four to Six. Below is a brief outline of the program by year. The specifics may change as courses change in each faculty. It is assumed that students do not take more than two years of course work prior to beginning HBA1; however, it is possible to undertake the combined program with more than ten credits prior to HBA1.

Admission to the Combined Program
See the policy on “Admission – Law”. 

Years One and Two
All students must complete at least two years of full-time university courses obtaining 10.0 credits. Students may take a wide variety of courses in any faculty. However, they must take Business Administration 2257.

Year Three
All students will take: Business Administration 3300K, Business Administration 3301K, Business Administration 3302K, Business Administration 3303K, Business Administration 3304K, Business Administration 3307K, Business Administration 3311K, Business Administration 3316K, Business Administration 3321K, Business Administration 3322K, Business Administration 3323K.

No substitutes for any of the above courses are permitted under any circumstances.

Year Four - Combined Program
All students must take first-year Law in Year Four. They may not take any business or outside courses during this year.

Year Five and Six - Combined Program

Progression Standards
Once admitted to the combined program, students must attain a minimum weighted average of 75% in their 4000-level HBA courses and a B- average in their Law courses.

Failure to Meet Progression Standards
A student who fails to meet the combined progression standards in any year must withdraw from the combined program. However, if that student has met the progression standards of either the HBA or Law program, the student will be allowed to proceed to the next year of that program. If that student has satisfied the progression standards of both individual programs, the student may continue in either program and may petition the School or Faculty whose program was not selected for permission to complete that program at later date. A student who is required to withdraw from the combined program, and wishes to pursue either or both of the individual programs, must complete all the degree requirements of the individual program or programs in order to graduate from that program or those programs.

Dean's Honour List
At the Ivey Business School, students are considered for the Dean's Honour List during their first year of HBA. Students enrolled in Years Five and Six of the combined degree program are considered for the Dean's Honour List in Year Six only. Only grades obtained in 4000-level Business courses will be used in calculating averages for the purpose of determination of Dean's Honour List standing. The Dean's Honour List for HBA2 typically includes the top 25% of all of HBA2 and is determined by vote of the teaching faculty. Courses taken outside the Business School are excluded. Calculations for Ivey Scholar and Gold Medals are completed in the same way.

A student who takes Law courses totaling at least 12 credit hours in each of Years Five and Six of the combined program is considered for the Dean's Honour List at the Faculty of Law in that year on the basis of those courses.

SCHOLAR'S ELECTIVES PROGRAM AND WESTERN SCHOLARS
Scholar's Electives Program
The Scholar's Electives program allows students who have demonstrated outstanding academic potential to apply to Western for admission to both a primary, discipline-based program/module of study and the Scholar's Electives program. The Scholar's Elective program is designed to provide an intellectually stimulating learning environment for students who truly wish to undertake an interdisciplinary and/or laboratory research experience. Its goal is to foster a community of scholars who have diverse disciplinary and research interests, but a general intellectual curiosity about most disciplines. The program is intended primarily for students who are interested in completing a four-year Honours degree before moving on to their chosen careers.

Those selected will comprise a small group (no larger than 75 students per year at the constituent university) who will, in addition to their Honours degree courses, enrol in a Scholar's Electives program comprised of 3.0 courses. The interdisciplinary courses in the Scholar's Electives program will be taught by faculty members from more than one Faculty and expose students to significant ideas from different disciplines.

The small enrollment in the program will enable the students to connect with one another and ensure greater individual contact with faculty members. Development and staffing of the Scholar's Electives courses will be the responsibility of the participating faculties.

Huron University College also offers a Scholar's Electives program leading to a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree under the same conditions. King’s University College offers its own King’s Scholar program. Admission to the program shall be granted by the Academic Dean (King’s University College) or Dean of Arts and Social Science (Huron University College) and, where appropriate, in consultation with the Dean(s) of the constituent university faculties involved in the proposed course of study.

Students who complete the first two years of the Scholar's Electives program successfully before registering in one of the Honours Business Administration (HBA) combined programs in the Ivey Business School may continue in the Scholar's Electives program and receive this designation at graduation.

While the primary benefit of enrolling in Scholar's Electives is the flexibility to achieve personal and unique academic goals, there are a number of ancillary benefits associated with the program. Scholar's Electives students will have the benefit of being paired with a Faculty mentor in Years 2 and 3. The mentor will hold regular meetings with the student to monitor the student's progress and provide advice if necessary. Students will also have the opportunity to network and build a community with other high-achieving students through planned activities and events. The current listing of minimum admission requirements to undergraduate programs from international curricula and countries is maintained by the Office of the Registrar. For admission requirements of international applicants, please refer to the International High School Requirements on the Western website.

Admission Requirements
Students apply for admission to the Scholar’s Electives program prior to registration in first year of an undergraduate program in one of the following Faculties: Arts and Humanities, Health Sciences (excluding the Arthur Labatt Family School of Nursing), Don Wright Faculty of Music, Science, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry (BMSc), and Social Science (excluding the DAN Management and Organizational Studies program). Scholar’s Electives is a limited enrolment program, open to full-time students who qualify for membership as Western Scholars by having at least a 90% admission average. Selection will be determined by a Selection Committee on the basis of grades and personal accomplishments, such as demonstrated achievement beyond the classroom and community contributions, as detailed on a supplementary admissions form.

Program Requirements
The Scholar’s Electives program is a 21.0-course program that includes an honours degree, with either an Honours Specialization or Honours double Major modules, as well as the Scholar’s Electives courses. The lecture/seminar courses in the Scholar’s Electives program are interdisciplinary courses developed and taught by a team of experienced faculty members. Mentoring for the Supervised Individual Research courses in Years 2 and 3 of the Scholar’s Electives program will be by individual faculty members who are experienced researchers.

Scholar's Electives Program
3.0 courses:

0.5 course: Scholars Electives 1100F/G (normally taken in Year 1).
2.0 courses from: Scholars Electives 2200E, Scholars Electives 3302E, Scholars Electives 3305E.
0.5 course: Scholars Electives 4400Y.

Students must be registered in a minimum of 5.0 courses during each Fall/Winter session. Scholar’s Electives 1100F/G will be taken in addition to the minimum course load of 5.0 courses in Year 1. With permission of the Department and Dean's Office, students with an appropriate background may be permitted to include senior courses in Year 1. In Years 2 and 3, the Scholar’s Elective courses will be taken within the minimum course load of 5.0 courses. Scholar’s Electives 4400Y will be taken in addition to the minimum course load of 5.0 courses in Year 4. After first year, students are required to take all of their courses at the 2000-level and above. (One exception may be permitted with Dean's approval.). Graduation regulations such as breadth and essay requirements, apply to Scholar's Electives students.


Progression and Graduation Requirements
To maintain their registration in the Scholar's Electives program, students enrol in a full course load (i.e., minimum of 5.0 courses) during the Fall/Winter session and must achieve a sessional average of at least 80% in all courses taken during the Fall/Winter session with no mark less than 65%. Students must achieve a mark of at least 80% in their 2.0 2000- and 3000-level Scholar’s Electives courses. If additional courses are taken during the summer session, students must achieve an average of at least 70% during the summer session, with no mark less than 65%.

Graduation requirements: Completion of an Honours Bachelor degree, including the Scholar's Electives program, with a minimum cumulative average of 80% with no grade less than 65%.

The diploma awarded to students will record both the status of Scholar's Electives and the module(s) studied, as recommended by the Dean.

Western Scholars
Nature and Purpose
The purpose of the Western Scholars designation is to recognize students’ outstanding academic achievement and to provide opportunities for program enrichment.

High-achieving students entering first year are eligible to become members of the honour society referred to as Western Scholars. Western Scholars are invited to participate in extracurricular activities through which they are exposed to a variety of cultural, social, and academic events, and are offered opportunities to participate in volunteer activities in the community.

Western Scholars are encouraged to pursue Honours Bachelor degrees. Although there is no requirement that Western Scholars take honours-level options, they are encouraged to select challenging courses that meet their academic needs.

The Western Scholars designation is noted on the student’s internal academic record, official transcript, and degree diploma.

Eligibility Requirements
Students entering full-time study with averages of at least 90% or equivalent are invited to be recognized as Western Scholars prior to the beginning of their first year as part of the registration process. Students with equivalent levels of achievement are also eligible. 
 
Students who were not eligible at the time of admission to first year or eligible students who did not accept membership in their first year may apply for the Western Scholars designation at the end of first year if their sessional average in first year exceeds 80% on a full course load (i.e., at least 5.0 courses in the Fall/Winter session), with no mark below 65%. In subsequent years, students may apply for the Western Scholars designation if they have met all of the progression requirements each session from their first year onward.

To retain the Western Scholars designation, students must achieve a sessional average of at least 80%, with no mark less than 65%, on a full course load (i.e., at least 5.0 courses) during each Fall/Winter session and a sessional average of at least 70%, with no mark less than 65%, on any additional courses taken during the summer session.

STUDENT RESPONSIBILITY FOR COURSE SELECTION
A student in a degree program must select courses in accordance with the published requirements. Many courses have prerequisites or require the approval of the department. These requirements, and any enrolment limitations, should be noted carefully prior to registration. Substitutions for prescribed courses require the written approval of the department and the Dean. Students registering in the Fall/Winter Session and intending to take second-term half-courses must register for those courses during the course registration period.

Students are responsible for ensuring that their selection of courses is appropriate and accurately recorded, that all course prerequisites have been completed successfully, and that they are aware of any antirequisite course(s) that they have taken. If the student does not have the requisites for a course, and does not have written special permission from their Dean to enroll in the course, the University reserves the right to cancel the student's registration in the course. This decision may not be appealed. The normal financial and academic penalties will apply to a student who is dropped from a course for failing to have the necessary prerequisites.

The final date for registration is the last day of the second week of first-term classes. Although every effort will be made to accommodate late registrants, students are warned that courses may be filled by that date.

Students registered at Western or at an Affiliated University College (Huron, King's) should note that if a course appropriate to their program is offered in an academic unit other than their own, they may register in it providing that their academic unit does not offer the course. However, students must have the written permission of the Dean of their Faculty prior to registering in a course that is offered both at Western and an Affiliated University College.

2. Concurrent Degrees - One Professional and One Bachelor Degree Taken at the Same Time.

Students who are currently registered in a professional degree may apply for permission to register concurrently in a Bachelor degree. Tuition fees applicable to the professional degree will be assessed and primary registration will reflect the Faculty offering the professional degree.

Students must consult the Dean's office of both Faculties for permission to register in, progress in and graduate with a second undergraduate degree with an Honours Specialization, Specialization or Major module.

A complete statement by the Dean of the Faculty offering the Three or Four-Year or Honours Bachelor degree must be forwarded to the student, with a copy to the Office of the Registrar specifying:

a. The courses that may be credited towards both degrees to a maximum of 10.0, with no more than 5.0 courses from faculties other than Arts and Humanities, Health Sciences (excluding Nursing), Information and Media Studies, Science and Social Science.
b. The number and kind of courses required to complete graduation requirements for the second degree including all senior courses for the Honours Specialization, Specialization or Major.
c. These Concurrent Degree regulations do not apply to Senate approved Combined or Joint degrees.

The Faculty of Engineering is permitted to offer Concurrent Degree Programs where graduating students will receive two Bachelor of Engineering Science (BESc) degrees:

one BESc degree for professional accreditation purposes in either Chemical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, or Mechatronic Systems Engineering, and one BESc in Biomedical Engineering
one BESc degree for professional accreditation purposes in either Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, or Mechatronic Systems Engineering, and one BESc in Artificial Intelligence Systems Engineering
Note: In the case of professional degrees for which normal admission requires one or two years of study in a Bachelor degree, the courses taken as part of such a degree must be included among the 10.0 courses double credited towards both degrees.

Students are encouraged to obtain academic counselling from the Dean of each Faculty during the course of their concurrent degree. Students who fail to meet the progression requirements of either degree will be required to withdraw from the concurrent degree.

3. Combined / Joint Degrees
